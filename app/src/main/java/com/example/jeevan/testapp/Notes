This project contains random features I wanted to test1Emp in the app.
The following index gives the test1Emp number and name. Files are prefixed with the test1Emp number.

Test1 :
    Simple db fetch and save.

Test2 :
    Showing fragment interaction using parent activity
    The main activity contains 2 fragments Content and Favorites in a ViewPager,
    As the name suggest, both list contain items that can be starred, Favorites contain only the starred elements
    Without using a DB, create the effect by passing messages among the fragments using the activity.
